# Predicting Fraud through Synthetic Financial Data

## Source of Data
This dataset was retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1

## Problem statement

How can we develop a fraud detection model that has a low false positive rate on
synthetic data generated from mobile money transactions in Africa for use in a
production environment immediately?

## Context

Since there is a lack of public financial data to develop fraud detection models, we need
to see if it is possible to develop a highly precise model from a synthetically generated
dataset
